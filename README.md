# Boolean-Calculator-in-Assembly
Create a program that functions as a simple Boolean calculator for 32-bit integers. It should 
display a menu that asks the user to make a selection from the following list: 
1. x AND y  
2. x OR y  
3. NOT x  
4. x XOR y  
5. Exit program  
First prompt the user to enter two values, have the user enter the values. Then display the 
menu and prompt the user to make an entry.  
 
If the userâ€™s entry is invalid, output an error message, show the menu and prompt the user for 
an entry. Repeat the previous process as long as the user will enter an invalid number. 
 
When the user makes a valid entry, display the name of the operation about to be performed. 
The values entered and the result after performing the operation. (be creative in your output) 
 
Make sure to display the numbers entered and the result in hexadecimal. (The Irvine32 library 
is required for this solution program.) 
 
Do not use procedures in this assignment (Other than the needed Irvine procedures).

This the code I designed and develped, a simple console program.
